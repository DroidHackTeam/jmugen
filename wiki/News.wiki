Here I will try to update what is done on JMugen at each evolution.

March, 08 2009
  * JMugen will be not just an Fight engine, but also a user friendly editor to create Sprite and stage, for this I add live debuging.
  * What is live debug:
    * break point before and after a state execution
    * change data on live
    * live custom evaluation


March, 04 2009:
  * Add Adx sound file support with loop (work correctly but need to refactor to AudioInputStream)
  * Faster PCX image building and conversion to texture. The improvement is 10 time faster.
  * Add Game Menu
  * Add Game Select
